Satoshi Universe
=================

Satoshi Universe is a game with social metaverse experience in sci-fi (cyberpunk) setting. It is a real time strategy game with mini-games inside the buildings. The world is divided by pentagons that can be bought and built on.

It is 2058, on the 50th anniversary of the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper, and a shock message posted from Satoshi’s Bitcointalk forum profile grabs the attention of just four people.

So we first encounter this alternate future universe... but its story is just beginning...
